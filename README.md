# Privacy Policy Analysis using Named Entity Recognition (NER)

This project aims to analyze privacy policies using Named Entity Recognition (NER). The goal is to automatically extract relevant information from privacy policies, such as business-related topics, legal aspects, regulations, usability factors, educational aspects, technology, and multidisciplinary aspects.

## Project Overview

Privacy policies are essential documents that outline how an organization collects, uses, and protects user data. Analyzing these policies manually can be time-consuming and challenging due to their length and complex language. Therefore, this project leverages natural language processing techniques, specifically NER, to automate the analysis process.

- This is but a primitive approact to the solution

## Dependencies

- Python (version 3.11.3)
- spaCy (version 3.6.0)
- pandas (version 2.0.1)

## Upcoming

- Better UI
- Definitely a more expanded corpus well accomodating more use cases

## Remarks
Privacy policy analysis has long been a daunting task, often left untouched in the vast realm of unread legal jargon. It's a place where the eyes of the most enthusiastic readers tend to glaze over, and where even the most patient souls lose hope. But fear not, for our Privacy Policy Analysis using Named Entity Recognition (NER) is here to save the day!
